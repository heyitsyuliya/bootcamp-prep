### Even and Odd

Define a function, `evenAndOdd`, that accepts an array.

`evenAndOdd` should return a new array. The first element in the new array
should be an array with all of the even numbers from the original array. The
second element in the new array should be an array with all of the odd numbers
from the original array.

```javascript
evenAndOdd([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]); // => [[ 2 ,4, 6 ], [ 1, 3, 5 ]]
```
