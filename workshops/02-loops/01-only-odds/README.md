### Only Odds

Define a function, `onlyOdds`, that accepts a number as an argument. `onlyOdds`
should should return the sum of all the odd numbers between the given number
and 1.

If `onlyOdds` receives an argument less than 1, it should return 0.

```javascript
onlyOdds(6); // => 9 (5 + 3 + 1)
```
