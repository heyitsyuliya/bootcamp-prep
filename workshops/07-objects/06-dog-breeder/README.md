### Dog Breeder

Define a function, `dogBreeder`, that accepts up to two optional arguments:
  1. name (string)
  2. age (number)

`dogBreeder` should return an object that represents a new dog! If the user
doesn't define a name, assume the dog's name is Steve. If the user doesn't
define the dog's age, assume the dog's age is 0.

```javascript
dogBreeder('Sam', 12)    // => {name: 'Sam', age: 12}

dogBreeder(15)    // => {name:'Steve', age: 15}
```
