### Pet Sounds

Write a function `petSounds` that takes an animal name and a country name.

Using the globally-defined animalNoises array, `petSounds` should return a
sentence that explains which sound the animal makes in the given country.

```javascript
petSounds('dog', 'Iceland'); // => Dogs in Iceland say Voff voff!

petSounds('cat', 'Korea'); // => Cats in Korea say Nyaong!
```
