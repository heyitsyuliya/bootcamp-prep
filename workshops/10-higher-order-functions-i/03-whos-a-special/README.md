### Who's a Special?

Write a function whosASpecial that takes an array of pets and returns a string
confirming what you already knew: all of the pets are very special!
Feel free to add your own special pets to the array!

Use .forEach in your answer.


```javascript
let specialPets = [{
    name: 'Sadie',
    species: 'cat'
  }, {
    name: 'Layla',
    species: 'cat'
  }, {
    name: 'Bogie',
    species: 'dog'
  }
];

whosASpecial(specialPets);
// => Sadie the cat is very special! Layla the cat is very special! Bogie the dog is very special!
```
