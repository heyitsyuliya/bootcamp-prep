### Count To Ten

Write a function, countToTen, that receives a number less than or equal to 10.
countToTen should console.log every number between the given number and 10,
including 10. Use recursion.

NOTE: The test for this function checks how many times you call console.log. If
you use console.log for debugging purposes, that's great! But your test will likely
fail, so comment out your console.logs when you want to see if you're passing
the test!

```javascript
countToTen(1);
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9
// 10
```
