### Backward String

Write a function, backwardString, that receives a string. It should log every
letter in the string, from the last character to the first. Use recursion.

NOTE: As with the last problem, the tests will check how many times console.log
is called.

```javascript
backwardString('happy');
// y
// p
// p
// a
// h
```
