### Tax Caclulator

Define a function `taxCalculator` that accepts the price of an item and a state.
`taxCalculator` should return the after-tax cost of the item, assuming NY's tax
is 4% and NJ's sales tax is 6.625%.

```javascript
taxCalculator(100, 'NY'); // => 104
taxCalculator(100, 'NJ'); // => 106.625
```
